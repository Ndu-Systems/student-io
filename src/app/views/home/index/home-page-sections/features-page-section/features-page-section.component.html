        It is not only available for students, but also for teachers, parents,
        and other institution employees. Where teachers can manage their
        classes, students attendance, assignments, and other tasks, while the
        parents can keep a hawk-eyed view over their young ones by using a
        single unified platform. This gives them better control to not only keep
        their tasks organised, but also reminds them who needs more attention.
